# Ensemble-classification---Project-2
Ensemble classification combines multiple models to improve classification accuracy. It involves training several models on different subsets of the data and then combining their outputs. The process includes tuning hyperparameters on a validation set and evaluating performance on a testing set. The goal is to make more accurate and robust predictions on new data.
