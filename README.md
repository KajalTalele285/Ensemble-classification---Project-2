# Ensemble-classification Project-2
Ensemble classification combines multiple models to improve classification accuracy. It involves training several models on different subsets of the data and then combining their outputs. The process includes tuning hyperparameters on a validation set and evaluating performance on a testing set. The goal is to make more accurate and robust predictions on new data.

The following are the steps for the Ensemble Classification project:

- Import and parse the breast cancer dataset.
- Create at least four different classifiers and determine the necessary features for training and test data.
- Combine the classifiers in an ensemble.
- Evaluate the performance of the ensemble using performance measures such as confusion matrix, accuracy, recall, etc.
- Clean up and document the code.
- Generate knitted document(s) documenting the project and its results.
